&lt;ul>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code starts by declaring a function called removeDuplicateFiles.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 This function takes in three parameters: $dirName, $distinationDirPath, and $recursiveCheck.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The first two are required while the third is optional.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The first parameter is an array that contains the names of all files in a directory or folders within a directory to be deleted.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If this parameter is empty then it will delete all the file else it move duplicate file at your destination path If recursiveCheck is true then it will check inside folder file also else it will only check current dir. and skip child or inner dir. The second parameter defines where to save any duplicates found during the search for duplicates (if there are any).&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 It can either be set to '', which means no destination, or specify another string value like '/path/to/destination'.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code will delete all the files in a directory if it is empty.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If the $distinationDirPath parameter is not empty, then it will move duplicate files to the specified destination path.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code is trying to find all the files in a directory that have an excluding extension of .mp4 or .MOV.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If it finds any (mp4 or mov files), it skips them and continues on with the rest of the code.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The first line sets max_execution_time to 0 which means there is no limit on how long this script can run for.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The next two lines create variables called $checksums and $moveFileNames which will be used later in the script.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The third line creates a variable called $distination_path that will hold where we are moving our file to after we process it.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code is a loop that iterates through each of the files in the directory.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The first line checks if the file extension matches any of the skipFilesExtenion array.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If it does, then it continues to iterate through all of the remaining files.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code starts by checking if the destination directory exists.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If it does not exist, then a new directory is created and given permissions of 777.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code then checks to see if the source file is a duplicate in directory or not.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If it is duplicate, then all files in that directory are the destination folder using removeDuplicateFiles().&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The hash for each file in the source folder is checked against an array of hashes that was previously generated with sha1_file().&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If there are any duplicates, they will be deleted from the destination folder before renaming them to their new name.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The next section checks whether or not this process should be run recursively on sub-directories within this path as well.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 This can be done by setting $recursiveCheck to true at line 3 above.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 The code checks if the destination directory exists and if it does not, creates a new one.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If the destination directory already exists, then it will check to see if any files in that directory are duplicates of files in the source directory.&lt;/li>  &lt;li> U+2705 If so, those duplicate files will be deleted from the Source directory.&lt;/li>  &lt;/ul>
